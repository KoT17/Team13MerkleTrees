# Team13MerkleTrees

Assignment 1
We will be:
1.) Implementing a sequential version of a Merkle Tree. The goal is to implement a straightforward single-threaded version of the container.
2.) Use the MRLOCK algorithms to convert the sequential implementation in a multithreaded implementation. One possible strategy to do so is to map each shared variable as a resource.
